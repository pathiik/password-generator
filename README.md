# Password Generator
This script generates a random password based on the user's input 

## How It Works
1. Prompts the user to enter the length of the password (minimumm 8 characters)
2. Prompts the user to enter the strength of the password.
    - Weak (Only letters)
    - Medium (Letters and numbers)
    - Strong (Letters, numbers, and special characters)
3. Generates a random password based on the user's input

### Example
1. User's input:
    - Lenght: 12
    - Strength: Strong
2. Generated password:
    - `Ik2m3\Lf>o;;`
